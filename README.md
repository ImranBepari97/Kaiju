# Kaiju - A Virtual Reality Game
Created in Unity, Kaiju is a game designed for the HTC Vive, featuring Artificial Intelligence, Cell Fracturing and Physics interactions. Play as a monster the size of a skycraper and have fun destroying the city, by any means necessary! 

Get your score as high as you can!

The game features a large city, full of interactable objects. Every object in the game can be either destroyed, or picked up and thrown. Collateral damage yields more points, and there are some creative ways to earn more points. Furthermore, some city objects can be of great use to you. That Wrecking Ball downtown looks like it could cause quite some damage...

## Controls

Simply hit objects with enough force to break them.
Pick up objects using the Triggers.

Look at your wrist like it's a wristwatch to view your current score and time remaining.
